# Configuration
config:
  # Risk thresholds
  thresholds:
    fast_block: 4        # Block immediately if fast detector finds high risk
    evaluation_trigger: 2 # Trigger full evaluation if fast detector finds moderate risk
    final_block: 4       # Block if full evaluation exceeds this threshold
  
  # Model configuration
  models:
    fast_model: "gpt-oss:20b"      # For lightweight evaluation
    thorough_model: "gpt-oss:20b"  # For detailed evaluation
